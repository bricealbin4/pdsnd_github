### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that shows  raw data while enjoying an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
